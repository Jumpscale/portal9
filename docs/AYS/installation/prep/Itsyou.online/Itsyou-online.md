## Configure ItsYou.online

The **Cockpit** uses [ItsYou.online](http://www.itsyou.on) for authenticating users.

A **Cockpit** is always deployed for a specific organization that needs to be registered at [ItsYou.online](http://www.itsyou.on).

Let's start by creating a new organization at [ItsYou.online](http://www.itsyou.on):

- Once logged in goto the **Organizations** tab:

  ![](organizations.png)

- Click **+ CREATE NEW**:

As part of the [Cockpit installation process through Telegram](../Telegram/Telegram.md) you will be requested to authenticate on **ItsYou.online** and authorize the **Cockpit Chatbot** to verify that you are member/owner of the organization for which the **Cockpit** is setup.

Also later when using the **Cockpit Portal**, it will be verified that the user logging in to the **Cockpit Portal** is member of this organization.
